    <p1>The Philadelphia Eagles are the best team in football.</p1>
    <br></br>
    <p2>Andy Reid, former coach of the Eagles, always said <del datetime="2016-10-20">To be the man, you gotta beat the man.</del>
      <ins cite="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/pattisonave/The-Best-Worst-Andy-Reid-Quotes.html"><q>In everything its my responsibility. It's my football team. 
      Its a reflection on me.</ins></q></p2>
    <p3>According to <cite>Donovan McNabb</cite> “It would be great to not have any injuries and just go out and play football and have fun, ... 
       But in life there are adversities, and it all just depends on how you overcome them.”</p3>

<p>This page was designed to introduce The Flash which was developed by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg and Geoff Johns. You can find more information about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Flash_characters">the cast</a>. The series premiered in the United States on October 7, 2014, on The CW television network. It is a spin-off from Arrow, existing in the same universe. The first season follows police forensic investigator Barry Allen who is gifted with super speed after being struck by lightning. He is assisted by S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, and Dr. Harrison Wells in attempting to learn more about his powers and how to use them to be a hero. Barry also attempts to solve the strange murder of his mother by a superhuman attacker when he was young, which put his father in prison, leaving Detective Joe West and his daughter Iris West to take in a young Barry.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
